# API Gateway / Lambda / OpenAPI / Pulumi

A Pulumi infrastructure script to setup a Lambda function, which can be triggered by API Gateway - Defined by an Open API specification.

The code is based off this example [https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/aws/api-docs/apigateway/deployment/#openapi-specification](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/aws/api-docs/apigateway/deployment/#openapi-specification)

I'm making this into a repo so I can refer to it in the future ðŸ™ƒ
